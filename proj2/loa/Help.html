<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h1>Rules</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to get all of oneâ€™s pieces into one group of pieces that are connected.
  Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is a path connecting any two pieces of that side's color
  by a sequence of steps to adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each of which contains a piece of same color.</p>
<h2>Game Play</h2>
<p>
  The two players take turns, each moving a piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece.
  Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.
  Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or
  onto a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board.
  A piece may jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross enemy pieces, except one that it captures.
  A piece must <b>move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move (the line of action). </b>
  This line contains both the squares behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the piece is on.
  A piece may not move off the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.
